<td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top;">Tennis is one of my favourite sports because it requires not only physical stamina and strength but also mental strength. It takes a lot of patience, practice, strength, and mental serenity to be a successful tennis player. It also helps to be smart in geometry and physics so that you know how hard to hit the ball, how to effectively angle it to make your opponents have to move for it, and how to add backspin to your shots.<br /> <br /> There's something exciting about tennis that I can't really put my finger on. Maybe it's that you're only playing alone or with one teammate, unlike most sports that involve large teams. Maybe it's the differing ground surfaces (grass, clay, concrete, etc.) depending on which area the game is being played in. Maybe it's the thrill of a perfectly placed shot after a long rally. Maybe it's watching your favourite professional serve ace after ace to defeat the opponent. Maybe it's eating an ice cream sundae from the concession stand between matches at the Rogers Cup. I'm not sure what it is, but I always feel excited to watch and to play the great game of tennis.<br /> <br /> <br /> ~ Frankie</td>
