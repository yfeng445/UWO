public class Degree {

  public int maxDegree(Node r) {
  /* Input: Root r of a tree
     Output: Maximum degree of the nodes in the tree
     
     You can use the following methods from class Node:
        - numChildren() returns the number of children of a node.
        - isLeaf(): returns true if a node is a leaf and returns false otherwise
        
     To translate the following pseudocode
     
        for each child u of r do { ... }
        
     use the following java code:
     
        Node[] children = r.getChildren();
        for (Node u : children) { ... }
   */




  }
  
}
