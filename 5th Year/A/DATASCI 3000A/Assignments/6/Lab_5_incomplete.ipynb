But as new instances are added to the training set, it becomes impossible for the model to fit the training data perfectly, it could be because, for example, the data is noisy. So the error on the training data goes up until it reaches a plateau, at which point adding new instances to the training data doesnâ€™t make the average error much better or worse. Now letâ€™s look at the performance of the model on the validation data. When the model is trained on very few training instances, it is incapable of generalizing properly, which is why the validation error is initially quite big. Then, as the model is shown more training examples, it learns, and thus the validation error slowly goes down. However, cannot do a good job modeling the data, so the error ends up at a plateau, very close to the other curve. These learning curves are typical of a model thatâ€™s underfitting. Both curves have reached a plateau; they are close and **fairly high**.\n","\n","If your model is underfitting the training data, adding more training examples will not help.
