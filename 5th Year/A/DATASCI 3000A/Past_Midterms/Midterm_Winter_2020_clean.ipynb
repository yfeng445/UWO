You are allowed to use any document and source on your computer and look up documents on the internet. **You or not allowed to share documents, or communicate in any other way with people inside or outside the classroom during the midterm.** To finish the midterm in the alloted 2 hrs, you will have to work efficiently. **Read the entirety of each question carefully.**\n",
