The actual probability is quite smaller than that. Bill wrote this in the late 1970s without the ubiquity of computers to perform the simulations we can.  It is quite plausible that Bill used a Normal approximation to arrive at this conclusion.\n",

Assume the batters are independent.  You can use python to evaluate any complicated functions, but do not estimate the probability via simulation."
