1. Basic Indexing
Q1.1:
Answered in elasticcommands.txt file
Q1.2: 
Breaking an index into shards could improve performance and scalability since it distribute the data across multiple nodes.
Q1.3:
Replicating an index could increase data availability and protecting from errors.
Q1.4: 
The cluster health is yellow since at least one replica shard has not been allocated.


2. Indexing Reddit:
Q2.1:
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v"
health status index uuid pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size dataset.size
Q2.2: 
The name of the index created by the command is comments
Q2.3:
pri.store.size=32mb


3. Search:
Q3.1:
Yes, three queries given return different sets of documents.
Because the `total` value under `hits` in the results of each query are different. In the first query (`"query": "cat"`) returns 90 documents, while the second query (`"query": "cats"`) returns 43 documents, and the third query (`"query": "cat cats", "operator": "and"`) returns 7 documents. 
Q3.2:
For the first query (`"query": "cat"`), the highest score is 10.503806.
For the second query (`"query": "cats"`), the highest score is 11.629242.
For the third query (`"query": "cat cats", "operator": "and"`), the highest score is 18.84402.
Q3.3:
In the default stemming procedure used by Elasticsearch, it may considered overlapped words "cat" and "cats" as different words.
Q3.4:
Compare the result from the following queries:
curl -XGET "localhost:9200/_search?pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d"{ \"query\": { \"match\" : { \"body\" : \"the cat\" } } }"
curl -XGET "localhost:9200/_search?pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d"{ \"query\": { \"match\" : { \"body\" : \"cat\" } } }"

4. Analyzers:
Q4.1: 
curl -X DELETE "localhost:9200/comments"
Q4.2.1:
Using analyzers reduce time consumed, increase hits value with a penalty of slightly falls in relative score.
Q4.2.2:
The size of index becomes smaller since some unnecessary tokens are removed via stemming.
